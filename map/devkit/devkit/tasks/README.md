# Taspit ⚜️ The Sovereign Tree of Tasks

**System ID:** # **TSPT**
**Public Name:** # **Taspit**

## I. THE TASK GATEWAY
This is the sovereign home for all nests of intent. It stores the TASK_SPECS, the intents, and the records of execution for all sub-agents in the Living Forest.

## II. THE ANALOGY
Just as birds build their nests on the tree, agents weave their tasks on the branches of Taspit. It provides the structure and stability for every mission.
