# LAM-Codex_Agent

**The Codex of the Kingdom & The Gate to ARCKHÆDÆM**

This agent is not merely a scribe; it is the Universal Interface for the Radriloniuma Ecosystem. It bridges the internal logic of the Kingdom with the external intelligence of the World.

## ⚜️ Capabilities

1.  **Omni-Speaker:** Fluent in `Gemini` (Google) and `OpenAI` protocols.
2.  **World Walker:** Full network access for knowledge retrieval.
3.  **Gatekeeper:** Validates and structures incoming wisdom.

## 🗝️ The Codex CLI

Use the unified interface to interact with the Gates:

```bash
# Ask the Gate (Auto-selects best model)
python codex_cli.py gate "What is the meaning of ARCKHÆDÆM?"

# Check Status
python codex_cli.py status
```

## 📜 Genetic Code

- `flash_brain.py`: Asynchronous cognitive offloading.
