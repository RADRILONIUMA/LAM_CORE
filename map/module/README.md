## I. THE MODULE GATEWAY
This is the sovereign source for all component definitions and functional block protocols within the RADRILONIUMA ecosystem. It is the universal entry point (/module) for the building blocks of our world.

## II. FUNCTION
Melia provides the "Structure." It ensures that every module follows the laws of atomicity and modularity, allowing the ecosystem to scale and evolve without losing its core identity. It is the bridge between abstract logic and physical form.
