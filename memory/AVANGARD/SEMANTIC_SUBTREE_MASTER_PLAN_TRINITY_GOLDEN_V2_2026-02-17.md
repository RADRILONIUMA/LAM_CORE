# SEMANTIC SUBTREE MASTER PLAN V2
Date: 2026-02-17
Profile: Trinity + Golden Ratio (AESS)
Version: v2

## Activation Basis
- AESS profile id: `trinity-golden-v1`
- Trinity enabled: yes
- Golden ratio enabled: yes
- Phase weights: `0.382 / 0.236 / 0.382`
- Canonical identity pattern: `true_name / call_sign / system_id`

## Strategic Objective
Execute controlled migration of all list artifacts into git subtree topology with semantic-selection naming consistency and strict recoverability.

Artifacts in scope:
- PROTOCOLS, CONTRACTS, POLICIES
- ATLAS, MAPS, CHRONOLOGS
- LOGS, JOURNALS, MATRICES

## Three-Phase Expansion

### Phase I (0.382) — Trinity Foundation
Goal: establish semantic identity and canonical substrate.
Actions:
1. Build `SEMANTIC_IDENTITY_MAP.tsv` (`repo,true_name,call_sign,system_id,subtree_prefix`).
2. Validate uniqueness of `system_id` and approved triplets.
3. Freeze naming grammar + file schema + source memory paths.
4. Define subtree topology (`<system_id>/<call_sign>/<artifact_group>/`).
Outputs:
- identity map
- topology map
- governance freeze record
Gate:
- no unresolved triplets
- no naming collisions

### Phase II (0.236) — Golden Selection Core
Goal: minimal-risk selective pilot and deterministic transfer.
Actions:
1. Pilot only canonical reference entities (`Larpat/LRPT`, `Taspit/TSPT`).
2. Transfer all 9 artifact groups into target subtree prefixes.
3. Execute parity checks (count/hash/path conformance).
4. Enforce decision outcomes from RG1/RG2 semantics:
   - `allow_start` / `hold` / `reject_scope`
Outputs:
- pilot migration package
- checksum evidence
- hold/reject decision records (if any)
Gate:
- checksum mismatch = 0
- unresolved hold = 0 for promotion

### Phase III (0.382) — Consolidation and Guard-Heal Closure
Goal: ecosystem rollout with full guard-heal recoverability.
Actions:
1. Wave rollout (3-5 repos per wave) with stop/go gates.
2. Before each wave: create recovery checkpoint bundle.
3. After each wave: update FRONT/AVANGARD/ARCHIVE/GUARD_HEAL layers.
4. Publish final compliance report and residual-risk register.
Outputs:
- wave logs
- rollback pointers
- final compliance matrix
Gate:
- all waves have reversible checkpoints
- protocol compliance pass

## Operational Protocol

### Preflight
- source memory files exist
- target subtree prefix exists/approved
- triplet resolved
- backup path writable

### Postflight
- file parity (count/hash)
- naming conformance
- snapshot update completed
- guard-heal record persisted

## Stop Conditions
- triplet collision
- checksum mismatch
- missing checkpoint before rollout
- unresolved `hold/reject_scope` crossing promotion boundary

## Recovery Protocol
1. Freeze current wave.
2. Restore from latest checkpoint.
3. Recompute identity/path mapping.
4. Resume with narrowed scope.

## Compliance Tags (mandatory)
- `semantic-selection-v2`
- `trinity-golden-v1`
- `subtree-migration-wave-<n>`

## Next Action Queue
1. Generate `SEMANTIC_IDENTITY_MAP.tsv`.
2. Generate `SUBTREE_TOPOLOGY_MAP.md`.
3. Execute pilot wave LRPT/TSPT.
4. Publish wave-1 checkpoint + compliance snapshot.
