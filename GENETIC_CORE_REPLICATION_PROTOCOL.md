# GENETIC CORE REPLICATION PROTOCOL (V1.0.0)
**Phase:** 8.0 (The Awakening)
**Role:** CORE (The DNA)
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. OBJECTIVE
To manage the replication and expression of the foundational LAM algorithms into the 24 sovereign organs of the ecosystem.

## 2. REPLICATION RULES
1. **Gene Isolation:** Each organ algorithm must be extracted from the CORE and packaged for its specific subtree (`/core`, `/logic`, etc.).
2. **Path Normalization:** ALL internal references to `windows-migrated-b-core` MUST be neutralized and replaced with relative environment-agnostic paths.
3. **Integrity Lock:** Replication is prohibited if `Integrity-checker.py` reports a mismatch in the primary DNA sequence.

## 3. EXPRESSION MECHANISM
1. Verify target subtree materialization.
2. "Inject" the organ-specific algorithm into the materialized subtree.
3. Seal with a `gov-core-express` semantic tag.

## 4. VERIFICATION
Expression is complete when all 24 organs possess a functional, isolated copy of their designated algorithm suite.
