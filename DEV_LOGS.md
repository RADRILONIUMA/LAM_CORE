Format:
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — action — result

2026-02-12 22:59 UTC — governance baseline seeded from SoT — required artifacts created/synced
2026-02-13 07:02 UTC — governance: roadmap observability marker synced for drift alignment
2026-02-13 08:30 UTC — governance: restart semantics normalized (ACTIVE -> Phase 1 EXPORT, NEW -> Phase 2 IMPORT) [restart-semantics-unified-v1]
2026-02-13 07:24 UTC — governance: protocol sync header rolled out (source=RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT version=v1.0.0 commit=7eadfe9) [protocol-sync-header-v1]
2026-02-13 07:53 UTC — governance: clean-clone reseed completed (protocol header + governance artifact baseline) [core-remediation-phase3-reseed-v1]
2026-02-16 07:26 UTC — governance: protocol hard-rule synced (`global-final-publish-step-mandatory-v1`) — final close step fixed as mandatory `git push origin main`; `COMPLETE` requires push evidence.
2026-02-16 07:56 UTC — governance: workflow optimization protocol sync (`workflow-optimization-protocol-sync-v2`) — enforced `M46`, manual intervention fallback, and `ONE_BLOCK_PER_OPERATOR_TURN` across repository protocol surfaces.
2026-02-17 00:36 UTC — sequential strategic execution started for repo #2 (`SEQ-WAVE-2026-02-17-A`) — baseline inventory captured and pytest gate passed (`1 passed`); roadmap phase matrix set to IN_PROGRESS.
2026-02-17 00:36 UTC — strategic scope formalized — module boundary contract added (`CORE_BOUNDARY_CONTRACT.md`) and README runtime surface declared.
2026-02-17 03:42 UTC — workspace sync hardening — added deterministic local test launcher (`scripts/test_entrypoint.sh`) for multi-session parity; verification passed (`1 passed`).
2026-02-17 03:44 UTC — sync expansion wave completed — added `pytest.ini`, governance+boundary suites, and expanded test surface from 1 to 5 checks (`5 passed`).
2026-02-17 04:01 UTC — recovery-clone consolidation completed — migrated retained artifacts from `CORE_RECLONE_CLEAN` (`TEST_MIRROR_MATRIX_2026-02-17.md`, `WB01_CORE_RECLONE_CLEAN_ANALYSIS_2026-02-17.md`, gateway contract test) and refreshed local gate (`6 passed`).
2026-02-17 04:05 UTC — sync expansion wave continued — added runtime surface contract checks and expanded suite from 6 to 10 checks (`10 passed`).
2026-02-17 04:10 UTC — negative-path wave added — gateway CLI error paths covered (unknown command, import without archive); suite expanded from 10 to 12 checks (`12 passed`).
2026-02-19 13:30 UTC — Phase 8.0: Genetic Core Healing Initiated. Goal: Resolve legacy path friction, activate gene expression for 24 sacred organs, and synchronize Task t112.
