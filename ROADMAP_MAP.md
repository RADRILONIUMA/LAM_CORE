phase_active: Phase 8.0 Selection — DECLARED

## Phase Layer
- Phase 4: DONE
- Phase 5.A: DONE
- Phase 5.B: DONE
- Phase 6: SELECTION COMPLETED
- Phase 6.A: BASELINE ESTABLISHED (atlas/security/multidisk)
- Phase 7.0: COMPLETE
- Phase 8.0: SELECTED

## Selection Focus (8.0)
- contract binding: `PHASE80_NEW_VERSION_BIRTH_ORCHESTRATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- readiness state: governance sync maintained and workflow-optimization rules enforced ecosystem-wide
- evidence basis: post-Phase70 selection + 2026-02-14 security matrix GREEN + 2026-02-16 expansion/lifecycle waves

## Active Governance Modules (Recent)
- M17: ESS map sync review and OS ATPLT startup gate
- M18: ESS expansion
- M19: growth/evolution lifecycle orchestration
- M44: local hygiene/error-fix synchronization (gitignore + protocol/map/log alignment)
- M45: ESSRCRD recovery governance lifecycle (detect/contain/recover/verify/close)
- M46: global final publish step (`git push origin main`) mandatory close rule

## Exit Gate
- maintain synchronized status across maps/logs/asr before execution activation.
